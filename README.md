# OpenAI GPT-3 Express Server

This project is a server application built using Express.js, which interfaces with OpenAI GPT-3 for generating text content.

## Technologies

-   **OpenAI**: Used for generating text content using the GPT-3 model.
-   **Express**: A web framework for Node.js used to create an API interface.
-   **dotenv**: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
-   **Nodemon**: Used as a command-line utility that automatically restarts the server when project files change.

## Documentation

For information on how to use the OpenAI GPT model, I referred to the [official OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt).

## API Keys

An API key is required to use the OpenAI API, which can be obtained on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Code Example

A code example for interacting with OpenAI GPT-3 through Node.js was taken from the [OpenAI documentation section on streaming API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming).

## Installation

To run the project locally, the following steps must be taken:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acvid3/ai-generation-description.git
```
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install dotenv express openai
npm install -d nodemon
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with your API key:

```env
OPEN_AI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Start the server using Nodemon:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```
